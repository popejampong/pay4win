' Attribute VB_Name = "clsReadTextFile"
' Text File Class for reading files
' Copyright 2000, Chuck Grimsby
' All Rights Reserved
' Use is free without restriction,
' I just keep the copyright!

' Class keeps 3 lines for the programmer to use:
'  .Text = current line to work with
'  .PreviousLine = the last line.
'  .NextLine = The next line for 'look ahead' operations
'  (occasionally useful to know what's next!)

' The class has it's own EOF property (EndOfFile).
' Use that rather then the channel's EOF.
' Since the class is doing it's own handling of channel numbers, inputs, etc.,
' using one that the class isn't handling could return erronious information.

' The BytesLeft should also be ignored.
' The class uses it internally for it's own purposes....
' The .LeftOver property is also something that the class uses
' for it's own use. Leave it alone!

' BufferSize can be set to whatever the programmer needs/wants.
' On files that have more then 4096 characters per line,
' this can be changed.  Unless that's the case, 4096 bytes
' (the default) usually works quite well.

' The .StripLeadingSpaces and .StripTrailingSpaces properties
' are used for formatting of the line within your program.
' Use as needed/desired.

' The .NoBlankLines property is for use when you'd rather
' not deal with blank lines.  Note that this setting doesn't
' apply to the .NextLine propery or the .PreviousLine property.

' The .StripNulls becomes useful in files that are "padded".
' I use this a lot on files that come off of Main Frames and
' are really ment to be printed, rather then read into a program.
' Most files =don't= have nulls (Chr$(0)) in them, so normally
' you'll leave this off.  (Turning it on slows the reads!)

' The .OnlyAlphaNumericCharacters property is also fairly useless
' except in some extremely rare conditions.  I can't remember why
' I put this in here, it changes the class so that it only
' returns the characters in the ASCII range of 32 - 127
' (Characters that can be printed), but not the so-called
' "upper-ASCII" characters that can also be printed.
' International users will probably find it =much= more
' useless then those in the US.

' The .CountOnlyNonBlankLines is for the count of lines.
' Personally, I almost always leave this set to False as
' I'd rather have a count that is more true to the format
' of the file, but I've had occurances where this is useful.

' You can set the LineDelimiter property to be whatever you
' want/need.  This becomes =really= helpful in files that are
' created on systems that don't use either Cr, Lf, or CrLf
' as line delimiters.
' The class will automatically try to figure out what the line
' Delimiter is if you don't set this.  It looks for Carridge
' Returns (Chr$(13)), Line Feeds (Chr$(10)) and the 2 of them
' together.
' The class will automatically look for FormFeeds and use those
' as additional Line Delimiters.

' This class can also be used on FixedWidth files.
' Just set the .FixedWidthLineLength property to the length
' of the line, and that's it.
' When the .FixedWidthLineLength >0, the line delimiters
' are ignored, so feel free to do so in your code.

' The methods used are:
'  .cfOpen to open the file set in the .FileName property
'  .csGetALine which is used to get the next line from the file
'  and .cfCloseFile to close the file when you're done with it.
'  Watch the .EndOfFile property to know when you're done.

' sample useage:
'Sub ReadAFile(strFileName)
'   Dim myTextFile As New clsReadTextFile       ' Create a new class internal to your program.
'   Dim myString As String ' Local String to play with in your program
'   Dim intError As Integer
'
'   myTextFile.FileName = strFileName            ' set the file name to read
'   myTextFile.NoBlankLines = True               ' Don't return blank lines!
'   myTextFile.CountOnlyNonBlankLines = False    ' Count all lines regardless of whether or not they are returned
'   myTextFile.StripLeadingSpaces = False        ' leave any leading spaces.
'   myTextFile.StripTrailingSpaces = False       ' leave the trailing spaces too!
'   myTextFile.StripNulls = True                 ' eliminate Chr$(0)'s
'   myTextFile.OnlyAlphaNumericCharacters = True ' don't send me any characters I can't use!
'
'   intError = myTextFile.cfOpenFile  ' open the file, return any errors in doing so (class doesn't handle them!)
'   If intError = 0 Then
'      ' no error in opening the file has occured
'      While Not myTextFile.EndOfFile                 ' Watch for the end of the file
'         myTextFile.csGetALine                       ' Tells the class to go to a new line
'         myString = myTextFile.Text                  ' set your string = to the current string of the class
'         Debug.Print myTextFile.LinesRead, myString  ' Show work in the Debug window. Optional!  Don't do in production!
'         ' want to see the next line?
'         If myTextFile.NextLine = <whatever> Then....
'         ' want to see the Last line?
'         If myTextFile.PreviousLine = <whatever> Then ....
'         <do whatever with the string here.>
'         ' want to find something in the file?
'         '     find a line within the file:
'         '      myTextFile.csFindLine StringToSearchFor, True
'         '          Note: Change True To False if you care about case!
'         '      myString = myTextFile.Text
'         ' on larger files, you may not want to do a line-by-line
'         ' search, so do:
'         '      myTextFile.csFindInFile StringToSearchFor, True
'         '      myString = myTextFile.Text
'      Wend
'   Else
'      ' handle the error here!
'      MsgBox Error(intError)
'   End If
